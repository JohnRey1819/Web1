AI Background Remover Web AppThis is a simple web application built with Python (Flask) and rembg that allows users to upload an image and remove its background automatically.This repository contains all the necessary files to deploy the application on a cloud platform like Render.How to DeployFollow these step-by-step instructions to get your own background remover website live on the internet.Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub RepositoryCreate a New Repository: Go to GitHub and create a new repository. You can name it something like python-background-remover.Add Files to the Repository: Add the files from this project (app.py, requirements.txt, and .gitignore) to your new repository. You can do this by:Cloning the repository to your local machine, adding the files, and pushing them back.Or, using GitHub's "Add file" -> "Upload files" feature directly on the website.Your repository should now contain these three files.Step 2: Deploy on RenderRender is a cloud platform that makes it very easy to deploy web applications. We will use it to host our Python app.Create a Render Account: If you don't have one, sign up for a free account at render.com.Create a New Web Service:On your Render Dashboard, click the "New +" button and select "Web Service".Choose "Build and deploy from a Git repository".Connect Your GitHub Account:Click "Connect account" next to GitHub and authorize Render to access your repositories.Select the repository you just created (python-background-remover).Configure the Web Service:Name: Give your service a unique name (e.g., my-bg-remover). Render will use this for your URL (e.g., my-bg-remover.onrender.com).Region: Choose a region that is close to you.Branch: main (or whatever your default branch is).Root Directory: Leave this blank.Runtime: Select Python 3.Build Command: This should automatically default to pip install -r requirements.txt. If not, enter it.Start Command: Enter gunicorn app:app. This tells Render how to start your Flask application server.(Your settings screen will look similar to this)Choose an Instance Type:For this project, the Free instance type is perfectly fine.Note: Free instances may spin down after a period of inactivity and can take 30-60 seconds to start up on the first visit.Create the Service:Scroll down and click the "Create Web Service" button.Wait for Deployment:Render will now pull your code from GitHub, install the dependencies from requirements.txt, and start your web service.You can watch the progress in the logs. The first build might take a few minutes as it downloads and installs the AI models required by rembg.Once the status shows "Live", your website is ready!Step 3: Visit Your Live Website!At the top of your service page on Render, you will find the URL for your application (e.g., https://my-bg-remover.onrender.com). Click on it to see your live background remover tool.Congratulations, you've successfully deployed a Python web application!
